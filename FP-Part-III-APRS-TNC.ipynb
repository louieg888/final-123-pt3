    "## Creating a TNC (Terminal Node Controller, i.e. modem) class\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture we chose for this lab is to create a class that implements the functions of the modem, while keeping joint state variables such that it would be possible to process buffers in real-time while maintaining continuity and integrity of the processing as if we are processing a large buffer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We created the infrastructure for you, implemented in the `TNCaprs` class. \n",
    "It implements an overlap and save approach. The constructor for the class takes in the sampling frequency: `fs`, the size of soundDevice buffer (default is 1024): `Abuffer`, and the number of audio buffers to collect before processing: `Nchunks`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `processBuffer(self, buff_in)`\n",
    "The method `processBuffer(buff_in)` takes buffers in to be processed, collects them into a large buffer made of `Nchunks`. Once the large buffer has been collected, the method calls the demodulation method to create an NRZI, it calls the PLL to find the sampling timings, it samples the NRZI and converts it to NRZ bits. Finally it calls the function that looks for packets in the bitstream. \n",
    "The method implements an overlap and save approach. So, it calls the demodulation function with a buffer that is overlapping and expects a smaller buffer containing only valid linear convolution samples in return. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### `demod(self, buff)` -- same as `nc_afsk1200Demod`\n",
    "Because there are 3 filters one after the other in the demodulator, each one of length N, the method `processBuffer(buff_in)` sends to `demod` a buffer sized `Nchunks*Abuffer + 3*(N-1)` and expects `Nchunks*Abuffer` samples in return. If you have different size filters, you need to modify `processBuffer(buff_in)` to account for that. The filters for `demod` are generated in the `__init__` function of the `TNCaprs` class. When filtering, use `np.convolve` with `mode='valid'` so that only valid linear convolution results are returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ` PLL(self, NRZa)`\n",
    "This is the same PLL implementation as before. The only difference is that the PLL counter: `pll`, its previous value: `ppll`, the stepsize: `dpll`, and the aggressiveness or nudge factor: `apll` are all class variables. This way, when the PLL finishes processing a buffer, the values are saved and used in the beginning of the next buffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ` FastPLL(self, NRZa)`\n",
    "The same implementation of the PLL -- but a wrapper to a C-language function. This is much faster than the one written in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `findPackets(self,bits)`\n",
    "This function is the same as before. The only differences are that the variables, `state`, `pktcounter`, and `packet`, are class variable and their value is kept from one call to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that we also added another variable: `bitpointer`. As you recall, the function looks for flags in the bitstream up to 7 bits before the end of the buffer. `bitpointer` is needed for the case where a flag is detected at the end of the buffer and extend to these 7 bits. That means that when we process the next buffer, we need to start after those bits, and `bitpointer` points to the bit we need to start with.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `modulate(self, bits)` -- same as `afsk1200`\n",
    "Function takes bits and afsk1200 modulates them. The sampling rate is initialized in  `TNCaprs.__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### `modulatePacket(self, callsign, digi, dest, info, preflags=80, postflags=80 )`\n",
    "Given callsign, digipath, dest, info, number of pre-flags and post-flags, the function contructs an appropriate APRS packet, then converts it to NRZI and calls `modulate` to afsk1200 modulate the packet. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task 1: \n",
    "* Convert your functions `nc_afsk1200Demod` and  `afsk1200` to `TNCaprs.demod` and `TNCaprs.modulate`. Make it into class form in which class variables are in the form of `self.variable` which are initialized in `TNCaprs.__init__`. "

The difference is that we will load data in small buffers of 1024 samples and process them over a larger buffer made of several small buffers.  There are two points to make here. First: the idea is that no matter what size of buffers you use, the result of the overlap and save should be the same. If it isn't, then you have a bug.... and believe me... I had many before I got it right. Second: Generally, there are some overheads associated with operating on different sized buffers. The performances will vary with different architectures and memory.  We will look at several sizes and measure the time to process about 9 million samples (3.4 min at 44.1 kHz)  \n",

    "Part of the APRS protocol specifies that when a message received from APRS-IS is retransmitted over RF, it should be wrapped in a 3rd Party Header. See the [standard](http://www.aprs.org/doc/APRS101.PDF) page 95 for more details. The extra information in a 3rd Party Header takes up 20 or more bytes in the info field of an AX.25 packet, reducing the maximum number of bytes we can safely transmit in a single packet. However, the APRS-IS servers and, most importantly, direwolf are able to handle longer packets which break the standard for safety when dealing with unusual character encodings. We can take advantage of that fact for the purpose of this project to avoid truncating the data in each packet even more than we already have to. \n",
